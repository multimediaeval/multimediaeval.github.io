MediaEval is an in-cooperation initiative with SIGMM the ACM Special Interest Group on Multimedia. There are discounts on MediaEval Workshop registration if you are a SIGMM member. 
Note that SIGMM membership is 20 Euros, so it's very much worthwhile to [join SIGMM](http://sigmm.org/membership) in order to receive the discount. 
Please let us know if you have any questions, especially about student discounts or need-based discounts.

For our online participants, we are happy to announce that registration is free.
