title: "MediaEval Workshop Registration and Information"
---
The 14th Annual MediaEval Workshop will take place Thursday-Friday 1-2 February 2024 (8:30-17:00) in Amsterdam, Netherlands and online.  

The registration for the workshop is opened. (We apologize that it is later than expected.) **The link to register** is [here](https://www.aanmelder.nl/mediaeval2024/registration).

MediaEval is a joint event with MMM 2024 and is an in-cooperation initiative with SIGMM the ACM Special Interest Group on Multimedia. There are discounts on MediaEval Workshop registration if you are attending MMM 2024 or if you are a SIGMM member. Note that SIGMM membership is 20 Euros, so it's very much worthwhile to [join SIGMM](http://sigmm.org/membership) in order to receive the discount. Please let us know if you have any questions, especially about student discounts or need-based discounts. For our online participants, we are happy to announce that registration is free. 

For in-person participants: The physical workshop will be held at the [Amsterdam Science Park](https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/contact/getting-there/). On Wednesday 31 January at 17:00 there will be a cultural event and dinner. If possible, book travel to be at the Wednesday dinner. (But note there will be a MediaEval-specific dinner on Thursday.) More detailed information about preparing for the workshop and about workshop program and logistics will be sent to registered participants by email.

As you previously read in an email, accommodation information please see the [MMM 2024 information page](https://mmm2024.org/attend.html#accommodation) Here are some additional tips: There are no hotels at the Science Park, so you want to get a hotel with an easy bus connection (or consider renting a bike). We suggest hotels near Amsterdam Amstel Station. [Hotel V Fizeaustraat](https://fizeaustraat.hotelv.com/) is one we like not listed on the MMM 2024 page. Note there is a direct train from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam Amstel Station, which takes about 20 minutes.
