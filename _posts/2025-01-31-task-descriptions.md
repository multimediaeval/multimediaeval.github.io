The descriptions of the tasks that will be offered this year at the Multimedia Evaluation Benchmark (MediaEval 2025) have now been published on the [MediaEval 2025 webpage](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2025/).

MediaEval offers challenges in AI that involve data of different modalities. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society. 
Results will be presented at the MediaEval 2025 Workshop, Sat.-Sun. 25-26 October 2025, Dublin, Ireland and Online. Between [CMBI 2025](https://www.cbmi2025.org/) and [ACM Multimedia 2025](https://acmmm2025.org/).

MediaEval is open to anyone who wishes to participate. Please watch here for an announcement to be posted when registration has opened (mid-April).
