The Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation (MediaEval) offers challenges related to multimedia analysis, retrieval and exploration. MediaEval tasks involve multiple modalities, (e.g., audio, visual, textual, and/or
contextual) and focus on the human and social aspects of multimedia. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

Signup for MediaEval 2026 is now open via the [MediaEval 2026 registration form](https://forms.gle/y1mNzrC68eGXRsUp9)

Data release will start soon and continue over the next months. Runs will be due at the beginning of May and the annual MediaEval Workshop will be held Monday-Tuesday 15-16 June in Amsterdam and online, co-located 
with ACM ICMR. 

Tasks descriptions are available on the [MediaEval 2026 website](https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2026/).
