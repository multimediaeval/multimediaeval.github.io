The Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation (MediaEval) offers challenges related to multimedia analysis, retrieval and exploration. MediaEval tasks involve multiple modalities, (e.g., audio, visual, textual, and/or
contextual) and focus on the human and social aspects of multimedia. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

Signup for MediaEval 2025 is now open via the [MediaEval 2025 registration form](https://forms.gle/y7v1VLP7D9vsbuqv5)

Data release will start soon and continue over the next months. Runs will be due at the end of September 2025 and the annual MediaEval Workshop will be held on Sat.-Sun. 25-26 October 2025, in Dublin, Ireland and Online, 
between [CMBI 2025](https://www.cbmi2025.org/) and [ACM Multimedia 2025](https://acmmm2025.org/). Remote participation will be possible for those who cannot travel to take part in the workshop in person.
