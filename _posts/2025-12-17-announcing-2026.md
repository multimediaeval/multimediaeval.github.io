title: "Announcing MediaEval 2026"
---

We are happy to announce the tasks that will be offered at the next Multimedia Evaluation Benchmark (MediaEval 2026):
* Synthetic Images: Advancing detection of generative AI used in real-world online images
* NewsImages: Retrieval and generative AI for news thumbnails
* Memorability: Predicting the memorability of movie clips and commercial videos
* Medico: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for gastrointestinal imaging

This year we will offer many of the same tasks as last year to give teams that missed the opportunity in 2025 another chance to participate. Also this year we emphasize insight into the tasks and the data, 
with a special invitation for “Quest for Insight” papers to be included along with the standard task participation papers in the MediaEval Working Notes Proceedings.

More information is available on the MediaEval 2026 website https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2026/. Watch that page for more information to be added about the tasks. Other tasks might be added 
to the list as well. Registration to participate in MediaEval 2026 will open in January 2026.
