  <!-- # please respect the structure below-->
<p><em>See the <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2022/">MediaEval 2022 webpage</a> for information on how to register and participate.</em></p>

<h4 id="task-description">Task Description</h4>
<p>The FakeNews Detection Task offers three fake news detection subtasks on COVID-19-related conspiracy theories. The first subtask includes text-based topics and conspiracy detection. The second subtask asks for graph based detection of users who post conspiracy theory (posters) in a social network graph with node attributes. The third subtasks combine the two, aiming at topic and conspiracy detection based on both textual data and graphs.</p>

<p>All subtasks are related to misinformation disseminated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on conspiracy theories that purport some kind of nefarious actions by governments or other actors related to CODID-19, such as intentionally spreading the pandemic, lying about the nature of the pandemic, or using vaccines that have some hidden functionality and purpose.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Subtask 1: Text-Based Misinformation and Conspiracies Detection:</em> In this subtask, the participants receive a dataset consisting of tweet text blocks in English related to COVID-19 and various conspiracy theories. The goal of this subtask is to build a complex multi-labelling multi-class detector that for each topic from a list of predefined conspiracy topics can predict whether a tweet promotes/supports or just discusses that particular topic. This task is identical to a task posed in last year’s challenge, but it uses a larger development and test datasets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Subtask 2: Graph-Based Conspiracy Source Detection:</em> In this subtask, the participants are given an undirected graph derived from social network data where the vertices are users and the edges represent connections between them. Each vertex has a set of attributes, including location, number of followers, as well as some texts posted by that user. Some users are labeled as misinformation posters, based on manually annotated tweets, and some are labeled as non-misinformation posters. This subtask asks participants to classify the other users in the graph, based on their connection to the labeled users as well as their attributes. Scoring will be based on correctly classifying users/vertices in the graph that have manually generated hidden labels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Subtask 3: Graph and Text-Based Conspiracy Detection:</em> This subtask combines the data of both previous subtasks with the aim of improving the text-based classification. For each text to be evaluated, the vertex corresponding to the author is specified in the graph. The goal of this subtask is the same as that of Subtask 1, but participants can make full use of the graph data and vertex attributes. This subtask will use the same development and a different test set from that of Subtask 1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="motivation-and-background">Motivation and background</h4>
<p>Digital wildfires, i.e., fast-spreading inaccurate, counterfactual, or intentionally misleading information, can quickly permeate public consciousness and have severe real-world implications, and they are among the top global risks in the 21st century. While a sheer endless amount of misinformation exists on the internet, only a small fraction of it spreads far and affects people to a degree where they commit harmful and/or criminal acts in the real world. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected people worldwide, and consequently, it has dominated world news for months. Thus, it is no surprise that it has also been the topic of a massive amount of misinformation, which was most likely amplified by the fact that many details about the virus were unknown at the start of the pandemic. This task aims at the development of methods capable of detecting such misinformation. Since many different misinformation narratives exist, such methods must be capable of distinguishing between them. For that reason we consider a variety of well-known conspiracy theories related to COVID-19.</p>

<h4 id="target-group">Target group</h4>
<p>The task is of interest to researchers in the areas of online news, social media, multimedia analysis, multimedia information retrieval, natural language processing, and meaning understanding and situational awareness to participate in the challenge. The target knowledge areas include Machine and Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Graphs Analysis Algorithms.</p>

<h4 id="data">Data</h4>
<p>The datasets contain several sets of tweet texts mentioning Corona Virus and different conspiracy theories and corresponding undirected graphs derived from social network data where the vertices are users and the edges represent connections between them. The tweet-text sets consist of only English language posts and they contain a variety of long tweets with neutral, positive, negative, and sarcastic phrasing. The vertices of tweet-graphs contain a set of user attributes as well as some texts posted by that user. The datasets are not balanced with respect to the number of samples of conspiracy-promoting and other tweets, the number of tweets per conspiracy class, or the graph structures. The dataset items have been collected from Twitter during a period between 20th of January 2020 and 1st of April 2022, by searching for the Corona-virus-related keywords (e.g., “corona”, “COVID-19”, etc.) in the tweets’ text, followed by a search for keywords related to the conspiracy theories. Since not all tweets are available online, the participants will be provided a full-text set of already downloaded tweets. In order to be compliant with the Twitter Developer Policy, only the members of the participants’ participating teams are allowed to access and use the provided dataset. Distribution, publication, sharing and any form of usage of the provided data apart from the research purposes within the FakeNews task is strictly prohibited. A copy of the dataset in form of Tweet ID and annotations will be published after the end of MediaEval 2022.</p>

<h4 id="ground-truth">Ground truth</h4>
<p>The ground truth for the provided dataset was created by the team of well-motivated students and researchers using an overlapping annotation process with the following cross-validation and verification by an independent assisting team.</p>

<h4 id="evaluation-methodology">Evaluation methodology</h4>
<p>Evaluation will be performed using standard implementation of the multi-class generalization of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC, https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef.html) computed on the optimally threshold conspiracy promoting probabilities (threshold that yields the best MCC score).</p>

<h4 id="quest-for-insight">Quest for insight</h4>
<p>Here are several research questions related to this challenge that participants can strive to answer in order to go beyond just looking at the evaluation metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which properties of tweet texts (word use, style, complexity) correlate with a tweet being labeled as related to a conspiracy?</li>
  <li>Are these properties stable over time and across posters? A priori would there be reasons to expect them to be?</li>
  <li>Which attributes in the graph correlate with a tweet being labeled as related to a conspiracy?</li>
</ul>
