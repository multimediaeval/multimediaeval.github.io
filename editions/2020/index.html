* On Friday 11 December (16:00-18:00 Central European Time) we will have the workshop opening presentation and the icebreaker.
* On Monday and Tuesday 14-15 December (14:00-19:00 Central European Time) we we will have two types of sessions: 
  * Presentation sessions: Begin with an overview talk introducing the task. Then, each participant presents a three minute introduction of their task. The talks are live, and followed by questions and answers. (Zoom/Gotomeeting)
  * Technical retreat sessions: Discussion sessions where organizers and participants exchange experiences on the task and discuss plans for future work. (Discord)
* The exact workshop schedule will be published here in the days before the workshop.
* Just before the workshop, you will receive by email the links to the workshop platforms.
-->
<!---
#### Presenter workshop information
* If you are presenting at the workshop, please prepare a three-minute presentation.
* You will submit a video of this presentation AND give the presentation live during a presentation session at the workshop.
* Your presentation should explain your idea of approaching the task, related work, how you approached the task, and the insight you gained. 
* You do not have to explain the task in your presentation. There will be a presentation at the beginning of the session by the task organizers, who explain the task.
* Upload the video online to a place where it can be downloaded. Then add the link to your submission on EasyChair. This video will be used as a backup in case of technical failure. Please submit your video by **Saturday 12 December AOE**.
* We also offer you the possibility of publishing your slides and videos on the MediaEval Slideshare/YouTube accounts. Please supply your slides and check the video publishing box on EasyChair.
* Find information about EasyChair and about the Proceedings Agreement.

    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/gamestory/"><h4>Emotional Mario: Believable AI agents in video games</h4></a>
    <p>The Emotional Mario task explores the use of human emotion to improve the performance of AI-based agents playing Super Mario Bros. We provide a multimodal dataset consisting of video and sensor data to be used to complete two different subtasks.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/music/"><h4>Emotions and Themes in Music</h4></a>
    <p>We invite the participants to try their skills in building a classifier to predict the emotions and themes conveyed in a music recording, using our dataset of music audio, pre-computed audio features, and tag annotations (e.g., happy, sad, melancholic). All data we provide comes from Jamendo, an online platform for music under Creative Commons licenses.</p>

    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/fakenews/"><h4>FakeNews: Corona virus and 5G conspiracy</h4></a>
    <p>Spontaneous and intentional digital Fake News wildfires over on-line social media can be as dangerous as natural fires. A new generation of data mining and analysis algorithms is required for early detection and tracking of information waves. This task focuses on the analysis of tweets around Coronavirus and 5G conspiracy theories in order to detect misinformation spreaders.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/floodmultimedia/"><h4>Flood-related Multimedia</h4></a>
    <p>Floods are one of the most common natural disasters that occur on our planet, and the destruction they cause is enormous. In this task, the participants receive a set of Twitter posts (tweets), including text, images, and other metadata, and are asked to automatically identify which posts are truly relevant to flooding incidents in the specific area of Northeastern Italy. The ground truth labels have been created by experts in flood risk management. The ultimate aim of this task is to develop technology that will support experts in flood disaster management.</p>

    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/lifelogging/"><h4>Insight for Wellbeing: Multimodal personal health lifelog data analysis</h4></a>
    <p>The quality of the air that we breathe as individuals as we go about our daily lives is important for health and wellbeing, However, measuring personal air quality remains a challenge. This task investigates the prediction of personal air quality using open data or data from lifelogs. The data includes images, tags, physiological data, and sensor readings.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/medico/"><h4>Medico</h4></a>
    <p>The fight against colorectal cancer requires better diagnosis tools. Computer-aided diagnosis systems can reduce the chance that diagnosticians overlook a polyp during a colonoscopy. This task focuses on robust and efficient algorithms for polyp segmentation. The data consists of a large number of endoscopic images of the colon.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/newsimages/"><h4>NewsImages: The role of images in online news</h4></a>
    <p>Images play an important role in online news articles and news consumption patterns. This task aims to achieve additional insight about this role. Participants are supplied with a large set of articles (including text body, and headlines) and the accompanying images. The task requires participants to predict which image was used to accompany each article and also predict frequently clicked articles on the basis of accompanying images.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/noaudio-speech/"><h4>No-Audio Multimodal Speech Detection Task</h4></a>
    <p>Participants receive videos (top view) and sensor readings (acceleration and proximity) of people having conversations in a natural social setting and are required to detect speaking turns. No audio signal is available for use. The task encourages research on better privacy preservation during recordings made to study social interactions, and has the potential to scale to settings where recording audio may be impractical.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/pixelprivacy/"><h4>Pixel Privacy: Quality Camouflage for Social Images</h4></a>
    <p>In this task, participants develop adversarial approaches that camouflage the quality of images. A camouflaged image appears to be unchanged, or even enhanced, to the human eye. At the same time, the image will fool a Blind Image Quality Assessment algorithm into predicting that its quality is low. Quality camouflage will help to ensure that personal photos, e.g., vacation photos depicting people, are less easily findable via image search engines.</p>

    <br>
  
    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/memorability/"><h4>Predicting Media Memorability</h4></a>
    <p>The task requires participants to automatically predict memorability scores for videos, that reflect the probability for a video to be remembered. Participants will be provided with an extensive data set of videos with memorability annotations, related information, and pre-extracted state-of-the-art visual features.</p>

    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/scenechange/"><h4>Scene Change: Fun faux photos</h4></a>
    <p>Tourist photography is due for a makeover, as people increasingly avoid travel due to environmental or safety concerns. In this task, participants create image composites: given a photo of a person, they must change the background to a popular tourist site. The special twist: a Scene Change photo must be fun without being deceptive. In other words, the photo fools you at first, but is identifiable as a composite upon closer inspection.</p>

    <a href="https://multimediaeval.github.io/editions/2020/tasks/sportsvideo/"><h4>Sports Video Classification</h4></a>
    <p>Participants are provided with a set of videos of table tennis games and are required to build a classification system that automatically labels video segments with the strokes that players can be seen using in those segments. The ultimate goal of this research is to produce automatic annotation tools for sport faculties, local clubs and associations to help coaches to better assess and advise athletes during training.</p>
