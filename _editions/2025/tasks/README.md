This folder contains `Markdown` (.md) files to all tasks for 2023 MediaEval edition.

## How to edit

Opening a file and clicking on the pencil logo (view Figure 1 below)

![Figure 1: Editing task content](/docs/task_edition1.png "Figure 1: Editing task content")

you will access `edit` mode on the file aand you will see something like below:

![Figure 2: Editing task content](/docs/task_edition2.png "Figure 1: Editing task content")

There are 2 main parts to the document:

* part 1 (lines 1 to 11) is the task file metadata. Here, you (task organizer), should fill in all `# required info` fields (title, subtitle, and blurb). When your task content is ready to be published on the website, to be shown on the website, then you should edit the `hide` property to `false`, this way your task will be visible on the website.

* part 2 (lines 12 to infinity) is the actual task content. There is a suggested structure to the document to be followed. This part accepts content with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and HTML syntax.

After you fill all content `commit changes` by filling the form below that edit screen and clicking on `Propose changes` as shown in Figure 3 below:

![Figure 3: Proposing changes](/docs/task_edition3.png "Figure 3: Proposing changes")

That action will open a new window in which you will confirm a `Pull request`. As you can see in Figure 4 below:
*  yellow arrow points out where you can select a reviewer (if you are already talking to one of the website admins), this is optional
* fill your comments on the `fill here` space as you believe it's required to support approval of your change.
* red arrow points to the button that confirms your `Pull request`
