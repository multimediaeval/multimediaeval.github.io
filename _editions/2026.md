The MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation benchmark offers challenges in artificial intelligence for multimedia data. 
Participants address these challenges by creating algorithms for analyzing, exploring and accessing information in the data. Solutions are systematically compared using a common evaluation procedure, 
making it possible to establish the state of the art and track progress. Our larger aim is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

MediaEval goes beyond other benchmarks and data science challenges in that it also pursues a “Quest for Insight” (Q4I). With Q4I we push beyond only striving to improve evaluation 
scores to also working to achieve deeper understanding about the challenges. For example, characteristics of the data, strengths and weaknesses of particular types of approaches, and observations 
about the evaluation procedure.

### Task List

**Medico 2026: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for Gastrointestinal Imaging**

Medico 2026 focuses on Visual Question Answering (VQA) for gastrointestinal (GI) imaging, with an emphasis on explainability, clinical safety, and multimodal reasoning. The task leverages the expanded Kvasir-VQA-x1 dataset, containing more than 150,000 clinically relevant question–answer pairs, to support the development of AI models that can accurately answer questions based on GI endoscopy images while providing coherent and clinically grounded explanations. The goal is to advance trustworthy and interpretable AI decision support for GI diagnostics.

**Memorability: Predicting movie and commercial memorability task**

The goal of this task is to study the long-term memory performance when recognising small movie excerpts or commercial videos. We provide the videos, precomputed features or EEG features for the challenges proposed in the task such as how memorable a video, if a person is familiar with a video or if you can predict the brand memorability?

**NewsImages at MediaEval 2026 Retrieval and Generative AI for News Thumbnails**

Participants receive a large set of articles (including the headline and article lead) in the English-language from international publishers. We offer two subtasks: retrieving an image for each article from a collection of images that can serve as a thumbnail, or generating an article thumbnail.

**Synthetic Images: Advancing detection and localization of generative AI used in real-world online images**

The goal of this challenge is to develop AI models capable of detecting synthetic images and identifying the specific regions in the images that have been manipulated or synthesized. Approaches will be tested on images synthesized with state-of-the-art approaches and collected from real-world settings online.
