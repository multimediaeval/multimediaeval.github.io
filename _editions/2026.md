The MediaEval Multimedia Evaluation benchmark offers challenges in artificial intelligence for multimedia data, with a focus on analysis, exploration, and information access and retrieval. Signup is open to anyone who wishes to participate. There are two types of participation: “standard” participation requires creating an algorithm for addressing the challenge and “insight” participation requires gaining new insight, e.g., into the data, the evaluation procedure, or the implications of the task. Participating teams submit their algorithms (for the “standard” participation) and write up papers for the working notes proceedings (both “standard” and “insight” participation). The larger aim of MediaEval is to promote reproducible research that makes multimedia a positive force for society.

In the 2026 edition, we will offer the same slate of tasks as in the 2025 edition in order to provide opportunities for teams who were not able to participate in 2025. Also, we will put special emphasis on “insight” participation. Specifically, we welcome “Quest for Insight” papers that examine characteristics of the data and the task definitions, the strengths and weaknesses of particular types of approaches, observations about the evaluation procedure, and implications of the task. 

Participating teams present their work at the annual MediaEval workshop. The workshop will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and also offer the possibility of online participation. If you are an early career researcher and funding restrictions are preventing your participation, please inquire about possible travel support. This edition will be co-located with ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval - [ICMR2026](https://icmr2026.org/).
